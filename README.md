## Awareness of the Nature

Humans *can* sense nature’s dynamics to some extent, but we've largely lost or ignored these abilities due to our reliance on technology and modern lifestyles. Here’s why animals often seem more attuned to natural changes than humans:  

### **1. Heightened Sensory Perception**  
- Many animals have sharper senses than humans. For example:  
  - **Hearing**: Elephants can detect infrasonic sounds (low-frequency waves) from distant storms or earthquakes.  
  - **Smell**: Dogs and other animals can sense changes in air pressure and humidity before storms.  
  - **Vibrations**: Some animals (e.g., snakes, birds, and fish) can detect ground vibrations before earthquakes.  

### **2. Instinct and Survival Dependence**  
- Animals rely on their senses for survival. A small environmental change can mean the difference between life and death.  
- Humans, on the other hand, have built artificial environments (houses, cities) that shield us from nature, making us less dependent on raw sensory input.  

### **3. Connection to Earth's Magnetic and Electric Fields**  
- Birds, sea turtles, and even cows can detect Earth’s magnetic fields for navigation.  
- Some studies suggest that humans *might* have a weak sense of magnetoreception, but we no longer use it consciously.  

### **4. Lack of Attention and Practice**  
- Ancient humans, like indigenous tribes, were much more attuned to natural signs—reading the sky, animal behavior, and subtle weather shifts.  
- Modern humans rely on technology (weather apps, news reports) rather than natural instincts.  

### **5. Brain Prioritization**  
- Human brains are wired to focus more on abstract thinking, problem-solving, and social structures rather than survival instincts.  
- Animals, having fewer distractions, are more in tune with environmental signals.  

### **Can Humans Relearn These Abilities?**  
Yes! People who spend more time in nature (hunters, farmers, survivalists) often develop a heightened awareness of natural changes. By practicing mindfulness and observing nature closely, we *can* improve our ability to sense subtle environmental shifts.  

This is a project to create a system that can help us heightened awareness of nature.
